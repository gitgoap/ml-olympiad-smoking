## Smoking Status Prediction Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file and the associated dataset for a Kaggle competition aimed at predicting an individual's smoking status based on bio-signal data. The model leverages the Random Forest algorithm and achieves an accuracy of 85%.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various features such as age, height, weight, waist circumference, eyesight, hearing, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, cholesterol levels, liver function tests, and dental caries information. The target variable is the smoking status.

## Procedure to reproduce the model
1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure Anaconda and Jupyter  Notebook are installed in the system.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and change the address of the training dataset.
4. Run the main code inside the notebook.
